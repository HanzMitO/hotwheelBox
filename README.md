hotwheelBox is an R package designed to help Hot Wheels collectors analyze and manage their collections. 
It allows you to load and explore data exported from https://collecthw.com/, and even generate automated reports or spreadsheets from your collection data.

I created this package as a passionate Hot Wheels collector who wanted better tools to explore and understand my growing collection. The package is still under development, and feedback is welcome!
This package is in a very earlie state.
I will maybe devolpe it further.

Have fun with it and good  luck with collecting your Hot Wheels
